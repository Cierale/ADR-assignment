Subject: Native, web, or hybrid app
Status: Proposed
Context:
The app needs to track the user's location to provide accurate restaurant recommendations and use GPS capabilities or integrate with location-based services.
Decision:
We propose to use React Native as our development framework. React Native allows us to build mobile applications using only JavaScript and it is very popular, meaning that there are numerous libraries and tools available.
Consequences:
We may face challenges if we need to implement native features that are not supported by React Native.
